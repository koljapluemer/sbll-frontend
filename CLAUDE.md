## Essential Tech Stack

- tailwind + Daisy UI. Actually use daisy components. Avoid manual CSS when possible.
- lucide icons (via the vue package)
- vue router
- global store via persistent pinia

## Architecture

Do NOT!! adhere to the classic folder-by-type architecture Vue comes with.
Instead, use the following folder structure (inspired by Feature-Sliced Design)

- `app`: Stuff that MUST be global, e.g. the vue boilerplate holding the router view. Can import from anywhere, if it must. Should contain little logic.
- `dumb`: collection of simple, reusable stuff. no business logic. may not import from ANY other high-level folder. may cross-import within the folder. put assets here (if needed)
- `entities`: models/entities. Should contain (global) store.
- `features`: ways of interacting with entities. one folder per feature. may NOT import one another. may ONLY import from `dumb` or `entities`.
- `meta`: for complex features interacting in turn with multiple `features`. One folder per meta-feature. May only import from below, and not from other meta-features. Name features CLEARLY and DESCRIPTIVELY (instead of short and confusing) with full noun and full verb action.
- `pages`: One folder per page (a page is something used by the `router.ts` file). If functionality is ONLY used on a given page, put it in the page folder, do not create features or meta-features that are only used by one single page.

Do not use `index.ts` file reexporting components, simply export directly.

## Guidelines

- Keep design lean. Use cards, wrapper divs and containers ONLY when necessary
- Keep style consistent across the code base
- Setup eslint and ensure green linter (not by disabling it, but by writing clean code)
- Keep files, functions and classes short, with a single purpose, on one abstraction layer. Split complex functionality when called for.
- Do not hallucinate features I did not ask for
- Keep copy and micro-copy short and to the point. Avoid waffling, avoid marketing speak, and avoid labelling everything with triple redundancy.
- make sure UI looks neat. Always put a form input BELOW the label in a new line. Responsive design.
- KEEP. IT. SIMPLE.
- always run `npm run build` and `npm run lint:fix` to ensure everything is well done. Fix problems by writing clean code, not by disabling the linter.
