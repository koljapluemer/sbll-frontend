- let's build a basic situation practice page [here](src/pages/situation-practice/SituationPracticePage.vue).
- Note: A situation has as data source the following two files, matching in name, differing in ending: `public/data/situations/eng/arb/at the airport.json`+`public/data/target_languages.jsonl`

For now, let's do a proof of concept: Allow clicking "Practice" on `src/pages/situations/SituationsPage.vue` and simply show some core data about the gloss matching a randomly chosen `procedural-paraphrase-expression-goals` entry's `finalChallenge`. Have a "done" button leading back to the situations page.
